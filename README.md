# Smart Lights with WS2812 and ESP Rainmaker

A WS2812 Smart light written for ESP32 on Rainmaker for a complete DIY alternative solution to all well known market brands.

I've always loved how the [Nanoleaf Lights](https://nanoleaf.me/) looked as a decor item/accent lights in a room but it has always been a bit too expensive for me to ever get one.

And as electronics and software engineer, I figured it would be quite easy create my own version for like about the 10th of the cost and even more features (like motion detection)

- WS2812 64 bit RGB Matrix
- RCWL-0516 Microwave Doppler motion detector
